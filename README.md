# monaco-languageclient-ng-example

It does the same as the regular monaco-languageclient [client example](https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient#examples) but inside an Angular Component.

## Getting started

npm is required

```shell
npm ci
```

The angular client we start last needs to connect to example JSON language server from the [monaco-languageclient examples](https://github.com/TypeFox/monaco-languageclient#examples), therefore start the server like this:

```shell
npm run start
```

Start the local Angular development server:

```shell
npm run start
```

It serves on the client here: <http://localhost:4200>. You can use the vscode launch config to launch Chrome for debugging.

Both client and server code is re-used from [monaco-languageclient-examples](https://www.npmjs.com/package/monaco-languageclient-examples).
